# SSH-Buster
SSH password buster. Basically it bruteforces the password, but ssh password buster sounds much cooler. I have included a dictionary, but it's tiny so you probably want to find a better one. This will not work if you don't have python 2 on your computer.

Fun Fact: Fail2Ban stops this right in it's tracks
